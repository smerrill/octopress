<p>This weekend marked the second annual <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.drupalcampnj.org&#47;" target="_">DrupalCamp New Jersey<&#47;a> at beautiful Princeton University.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I was happy to fill in when a presenter dropped out and presented a session called "Testing Drupal with Ghosts and Gherkins". In this presentation, I talked about how both CasperJS or Behat could be brought to bear to test a Drupal application and gave some demos of each. The slides are embedded below.<&#47;p></p>

<&#47;p>
<p>Here are some links to the items demoed in the presentation so that you can give them a shot on your own sites.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Information about CasperJS is available at its website, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;casperjs.org&#47;">casperjs.org<&#47;a>. You can read more about CasperJS's parent project, PhantomJS, at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;phantomjs.org&#47;">phantomjs.org<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The sample CasperJS scripts adapted from our Testing with Friendly Ghosts presentation are available on GitHub at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;ericduran&#47;friendly-ghosts-examples">github.com&#47;ericduran&#47;friendly-ghosts-examples<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Similarly, documentation for both Behat and the Mink browser-testing extension is available at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;behat.org&#47;">behat.org<&#47;a>. <&#47;p></p>
<p>If you'd like to try out a sample project that uses Behat and Mink and one custom Mink step definition to test some sample assertions on the Phase2 website, it's on GitHub at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;phase2&#47;behat-phase2tech&#47;">github.com&#47;phase2&#47;behat-phase2tech&#47;<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Finally, our set of Drupal-based Behat and Mink step definitions are released as Open Source on GitHub at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;phase2&#47;behat-drupal-extension">github.com&#47;phase2&#47;behat-drupal-extension<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
